# otzar-prints
Creating a single HTML page that contains the whole thread's pages in the Otzar Ha'choch'ma forum (it's a phpBB based forum) in the goal of enabling print it in once.

Actually the newer versions of the phpBB do contain the ability to print all the thread's pages, unfortunately, Otzar Ha'choch'ma doesn't update their phpBB version.

To use it: Execute _otzar.exe_ (you can download it via _releases_ section) in the CLI with two parameters, first is the thread number on Otzar Ha'choch'ma forum, and the 2nd is the filename of the output page (that will contain all the thread's pages).
